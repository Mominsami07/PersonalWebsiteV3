                <p>Enthusiastic web developer with a passion for creating intuitive web interfaces. Third-year student, studying Web Design & Development, improving my knowledge by developing complex personal projects and client solutions in my spare time.</p>
                <p>Being a fast learner I can easily acquire new knowledge to integrate inside projects without losing my focus on the deadline. Working in small teams made me become a very communicative person with good leadership skills that can help to solve problems even in stressful conditions.</p>
                <p>I am a perfectionist and I love challenges, the harder the milestone, the more I enjoy it.</p>
